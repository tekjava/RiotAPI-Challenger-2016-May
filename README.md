# RiotAPI-Challenger-2016-May

THIS REPOSITORY FOR A RIOT API CHALLENGE ENTRY AND THE DATA IS PROVIDED BY RIOT AND ONLY RIOT

FOR A LIVE DEMO GOTO http://amazonsaver.uk/

With LoLMastery.ff everybody can access anybody's data about their champion masteries with full detail, in addition to that it also shows their ranked info with every champion and their ranked status. You can also find a top list which is sorted by depending on the champion points, seperate from that there are only master and challenger top list with their champion points and mastery scores.

The data is stored in a database that is only used for LoLMastery.ff.

The functions in code are self explainatory but howerver due to lack of the production key, we have put sleep(x) in certain part of the code just so not to spam the api call and x can be changed if and when production key is available.
